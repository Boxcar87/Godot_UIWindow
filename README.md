This class handles stricly the parent window that content snaps into. I have included 2 rudimentary ui elements as placeholders.

Import files into a Godot project (v4.5) (clone or download from packed godot project in releases)
Open test_scene or build with test_scene as main scene

"T" and "R" keys open windows

Due to hastiness of demo conversion the key inputs will only work if the scene background is "focused" much more preferable to use Input functionality in Godot.

Settings will persist in AppData/Local/ExampleGame/UISettings.json

UIWindow class contains the meat of the functionality and UIWindowController handles population
