Import files into a Godot project (v4.5) (clone or download from packed godot project in releases)
Open test_scene or build with test_scene as main scene

"T" and "R" keys open windows

Due to hastiness of demo conversion the key inputs will only work if the scene background is "focused" much more preferable to use Input functionality in Godot.

Settings will persist in AppData/Local/ExampleGame/UISettings.json
